# DotNetChartingApp

I am using the Chartist.js library and the .Net framework to create a full stack application that will store data in an SQL, relational database for retrieval and display in the form of a line graph and a pie chart.

It is made with the intention of displaying information in a similar way to that of Real Page, a local (and international) SaaS company focused on providing services to rental management businesses.
